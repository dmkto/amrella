### Dear Amrella Users,

### Subject: Closure of Amrella Social Platform

I hope this letter finds you in good health and high spirits. It is with deep regret and a heavy heart that I write to you today on behalf of the Amrella team. We are deeply saddened to inform you that, after careful consideration and evaluation, we have made the difficult decision to close down Amrella, our beloved social platform.

Amrella was created with the intention of providing a safe and inclusive online space where people from all walks of life could connect, share, and engage in meaningful conversations. We worked tirelessly to uphold the principles outlined in our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, striving to ensure that every user felt valued and respected.

Our commitment to maintaining a high standard of decency, respecting diversity, and safeguarding the privacy of our users was unwavering. However, despite our best efforts, we faced challenges that ultimately led to this unfortunate decision.

The decision to close Amrella was not made lightly, and it comes as a result of the platform's inability to sustain itself due to a lack of sufficient user engagement. We understand the disappointment and frustration this may cause to our dedicated users, and we sincerely apologize for any inconvenience or disruption this may cause in your online social interactions.

We want to take this opportunity to remind you of the key points outlined in our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy:

1.  **Decency and Respect:** We encouraged all users to maintain a high standard of decency and respect while using Amrella, with a strict prohibition on content or comments that promote prejudice or discrimination.

2.  **Age Requirement:** Users must be at least 13 years old to sign up for an account to ensure a safe and suitable environment for young users.

3.  **Account Usage:** Users could use their real names or aliases, but any portrayal of inappropriate content was strictly prohibited.

4.  **Reporting Suspicious Activities:** Users had the ability to report suspicious activities and content, but misuse of this feature resulted in account suspensions.

5.  **Privacy and Data Retention:** We were committed to protecting your privacy, and our policies outlined how we handled your data and content.

We want to express our deepest gratitude to all of you who joined us on this journey. Your contributions, discussions, and interactions made Amrella a unique and vibrant community. While the platform may no longer be active, we hope that the connections and friendships formed on Amrella continue to thrive elsewhere in the digital world.

For those who wish to retrieve their data or have any questions or concerns regarding your Amrella account, please feel free to contact us at [<support@amrella.com>]. We will do our best to assist you during this transition.

Once again, we apologize for any inconvenience this closure may cause and thank you for your understanding. We are immensely grateful for the time you spent with us on Amrella.

Sincerely,

**Dewan Mukto** \
Founder, Amrella
